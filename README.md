We aim responsible consumption and production, and that's why we developed this project. Our project aims to prevent the waste of daily food left in restaurants and wasted by going to trash bin. Thanks to the Food App, restaurant owners will be able to publish their excess edible products on this platform at the end of the day, and customers will be able to buy these products at a cheaper price. This project is also very useful for our users who have a busy work life and have difficulty in preparing meals at home and cannot find time for it. Thanks to the Food App, they will  have access to both affordable and ready meals quickly.
Example1: Ali spends most of his day at work and does not have time to prepare meals at home, besides he tries to pay attention to his expenses. Ali can order food from the Food App after work, and he will have access to affordable food and does not waste time preparing food.
Example2: Restaurant X prepares fresh and delicious meals every day, but some days they cannot sell all the meals they prepare and at the end of the day they throw the food away because it is not fresh. Restaurant X starts using the Food App and at the end of the day sells its meals to customers at a more affordable price and prevents food waste.
